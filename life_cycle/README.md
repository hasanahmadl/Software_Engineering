# Software Development Life Cycle
#### 1 - Requirement Analysis
#### 2 - Design
#### 3 - Implementation
#### 4 - Testing
#### 5 - Maintenance

The set of activities, methods, tools, and diagrams are interlinked
That leads to understanding the problem and finding a feasible new system to solve that problem, which achieves low cost
High quality and customer satisfaction.
