# Software Development Life Cycle
#### 1 - Requirement Analysis
#### 2 - Design
#### 3 - Implementation
#### 4 - Testing
#### 5 - Maintenance

## The Software Process
The set of activities, methods, tools, and diagrams are interlinked
That leads to understanding the problem and finding a feasible new system to solve that problem, which achieves low cost
High quality and customer satisfaction.

These activities are divided into four general sections:

1- Analysis

2- Design

3- Test

4- Maintenance

##### The procedural model is the way in which those previous activities are reported according to a specific procedure or method.
<hr>

### 1- Analysis:
What is required of the system or what the system provides in terms of services and this is what we know from stake holders.
##### Stake holders: They are persons or institutions represented by people who directly or indirectly influence or are affected by the system.
