# Software Development Life Cycle
#### 1 - Requirement Analysis
#### 2 - Design
#### 3 - Implementation
#### 4 - Testing
#### 5 - Maintenance

## The Software Process
The set of activities, methods, tools, and diagrams are interlinked
That leads to understanding the problem and finding a feasible new system to solve that problem, which achieves low cost
High quality and customer satisfaction.

These activities are divided into four general sections:

1- Analysis

2- Design

3- Test

4- Maintenance

##### The procedural model is the way in which those previous activities are reported according to a specific procedure or method.

### 1- Analysis:
What is required of the system or what the system provides in terms of services and this is what we know from stake holders.
##### Stake holders: They are persons or institutions represented by people who directly or indirectly influence or are affected by the system.

After the problem identification process, we identify the stakeholders and then carry out the requirements gathering process.
After the requirements gathering process, we analyze and classify the requirements in agreement with the stakeholders and this is what we call the description.
 

### 2- Design: 
This stage we move from the stage of what is required of the system to the stage of achieving what is required of this system

- Develop the system architecture.
- Developing the necessary algorithms for each of the parts as it depends on the work of the analyst and distributes the services provided by the analyst to those integrated parts that make up the system.
- Designing the database and plans needed for the system.
- Designing the interfaces for the software system.


### 3- Implementation:
At this stage, the programmer writes the algorithms designed by the designer and converts them into code.

### 4- Testing: 
the stage of testing the system and discovering errors.
