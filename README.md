# What is Software Engineering
Software engineering means building a new product or systems or modifying and developing old system and improving their mistakes,
as well as finding problems that already exist. 

## Software
A software is the programs with data and documentation, and we do not mean here to document the comments between the lines of the program.
Documenting all the steps we are talking to develop any software system at all stages of analysis, design, implementation and testing.


## Software products
#### 1-	Generic product:
Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.

Examples: – PC software such as graphics programs, project management tools; CAD software; software for specific markets such as appointments systems for dentists

#### 2-	Customized products:
 Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.

Examples: – embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems.


### The Good Software:
Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.

#### Dependency: 
###### 1-	Security

         The user or anyone should not have access to information within the system that he does not have to access.

###### 2-	Availability

        The system should always be available.

###### 3-	Reliability

        The system must be reliable (such as a money transfer system between two accounts).

###### 4-	Safety

        Protection must be available in some systems such as aviation systems.
